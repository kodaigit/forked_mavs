*NOTICE*
Thank you for your interest in MAVS, we hope it serves you well!  We have a few small requests to ask of you that will help us continue to create innovative platforms:
-To share MAVS with a friend, please ask them to visit https://gitlab.com/cgoodin/msu-autonomous-vehicle-simulator to register and download MAVS for free.
-Feel free to create derivative works for non-commercial purposes, i.e. academics, U.S. government, and industry research.  If commercial uses are intended, please contact us for a commercial license at otm@msstate.edu or jonathan.rudd@msstate.edu.
-Finally, please use the ACKNOWLEDGEMENT above in your derivative works.  This helps us both!

Please visit https://gitlab.com/cgoodin/msu-autonomous-vehicle-simulator to view the full license, or email us if you have any questions.
